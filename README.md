# Workshop: Introduction to machine learning with {tidymodels} in R
Machine learning (ML) is an important aspect of data science that can be used to create predictions, make classifications, and uncover insights in data that can be difficult to detect. 
{tidymodels} is a collection of R packages that can be used for various aspects of machine learning pipelines, including sampling data, building and fitting models, and performance evaluation. {tidymodels} provides a consistent, user-friendly approach to fitting machine learning models in R.
